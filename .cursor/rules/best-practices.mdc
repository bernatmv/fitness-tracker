- Single responsibility: each code entity should only be responsible for a single task. When in doubt prioritize this rule.
- Always prefer composition over inheritance.
- Loose coupling: reduce as much as possible dependencies between modules.
- Pure functions are prefered.
- Small functions are prefered.
- Everything should be typed.
- Code should follow SOLID principles.
- Code should follow DRY principle: code should be re-usable, we can achieve this with smaller and less coupled components.
- Code should follow KISS principle: code should be as simple as possible, as isolated as possible and as testable as possible.
- Code should follow YAGNI principle: don't over architecture, don't create abstractions where they are not needed, it's easier to maintain something simpler that can be better understood as long as it doesn't violate previous principles.
